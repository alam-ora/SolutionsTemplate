# Provision Cloud Resources Using Resource Manager

In this section you will use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure **Resource Manager** to provision the cloud resources required for this solution.

> **Resource Manager** uses Terraform to help install, configure, and manage cloud resources through the "infrastructure-as-code" model. Click [here](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/resourcemanager.htm) to learn more about OCI Resource Manager.

### Prerequisites

* [Download](./tf/vcn-compute.zip) the prebuilt Terraform script for this solution.

## Provisioning Steps

### STEP 1 : Sign In to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console

Sign in to your **Cloud Account** from Oracle Cloud website. You will be prompted to enter your cloud tenant, user name, and password.

> For more details, refer to the documentation on [*Getting Started with Oracle Cloud*](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/get-started/subscriptions-cloud/csgsg/sign-your-account-oracle-cloud-website.html).

### STEP 2 : Create the Stack

Creating a **Stack** involves uploading the Terraform configuration file, providing identifying information for the new stack, and (optionally) setting the variables.

> A **Stack** is a collection of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources corresponding to a given Terraform configuration. Each stack resides in the **Compartment** you specify, in a single **Region**. However, resources in a given stack can be deployed across multiple regions.

1. Open the **Navigation Menu** on the top-left. Under **Solutions and Platform**, locate **Resource Manager** and click **Stacks**.

2. Choose a **Compartment** that you have permission to work in (towards the left of the page), and ensure you are in the correct **Region** (towards the top of the page). Click **Create Stack**.

![](./images/click-stacks.png)

3. In the **Create Stack** dialog, enter the following :

	* Add the Terraform configuration file (**vcn-compute.zip**) that you've downloaded earlier. You can either drag and drop it onto the dialog box or click **Browse** and navigate to the file location.
	
	* Enter a **Name** for the new stack (or accept the default name provided).
	
	* Optionally, enter a **Description**.
	
	* From the **Create in Compartment** drop-down, select the **Compartment** where you want to create the stack.
	
	* Select the **Terraform Version** as **0.11.x**. 
		>Note that the Terraform version is not backward compatible.

	* Optionally, you can apply tags. 
		>Refer to the documentation section [*Tagging Overview*](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Tagging/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm) for details on OCI Tagging.
		
	* Click **Next**.

4. Configure the variables the cloud resources will need when the stack gets created and when you run the apply job. Enter the following values in this dialog :

	* **Tenancy OCID** & **Compartment OCID**.

		>Click [here](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) for the steps on locating your **Tenancy** and **Compartment OCIDs**.

	* Enter the Cloud **Region**'s identifier where you like the resources to be created. 

		>Refer to the documentation on Cloud [Regions](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm) to get the identifier for the region.

	* Enter the **Public Key** to be used by the VM (public key begins with **ssh-rsa** as in the below screeshot).

		>Refer to the tutorial on [Generating an SSH Key Pair for Oracle Compute Cloud Service Instances](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/cloud/compute-iaas/generating_ssh_key/generate_ssh_key.html).

	* Click **Next**.

5. In the **Review** panel, verify your stack configuration.
Click **Create** to create the Stack.

6. Verify the Stack creation on the **Stack Details** page.

### STEP 3 : Run a Plan Job

Running a plan job parses the Terraform configuration (.zip) file and converts it into an execution plan listing resources and actions that will result when an apply job is run. We recommend generating the execution plan before running an apply job.

1. On the previous **Stack Details** page, click on **Terraform Actions** -> **Plan**.

![](./images/stacks-tf-plan.png)

2. Review the plan job **Name** and update if needed. Click **Plan**.

![](./images/stacks-plan.png)

3. The new plan job is listed under **Jobs**, with an initial state of **Accepted**. Soon the status changes to **In Progress**. 

![](./images/plan-in-progress.png)

4. When the plan job is successful, the status will change to **Succeeded**.

![](./images/plan-job-succeeded.png)

5. Scroll to the bottom of the plan log and verify there are no errors, and the plan indicates the resources will be added. 

![](./images/plan-job-verify-log.png)

### STEP 4 : Run an Apply Job

When you run an apply job for a Stack, Terraform creates the resources and executes the actions defined in the Terraform configuration (.zip) file. The time required to complete an apply job depends on the number and type of cloud resources to be created.

1. Browse to the **Stack Details** page by clicking the link from the breadcrumbs as follows :

![](./images/job-details-stack-breadcrumb.png)

2. Go to **Terraform Actions** and select **Apply**.

![](./images/plan-apply.png)

3. In the **Apply** dialog, review the apply job **Name** and ensure the **Apply Job Plan Resolution** is set to **Automatically Approve**.

	> You may optionally add **Tag** information. Refer to the documentation section [*Tagging Overview*](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Tagging/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm) for details on OCI Tagging.

4. Click **Apply**.

![](./images/apply-job.png)

5. The new apply job gets **Accepted** status. 

![](./images/apply-accepted.png)

6. The apply job status will quickly change to **In Progress**. 

![](./images/apply-in-progress.png)

7. The job will take a few minutes to complete and will change status to **Succeeded** when successfully completed.

![](./images/apply-job-succeeded.png)

8. Verify the apply log by scrolling down to the **log** section and validate the resource creation was successful.

### STEP 5 : Validate the Cloud Resources
